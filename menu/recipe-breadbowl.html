          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Pour the very warm water into a bowl. Add the yeast and sugar and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
              <li>Mix with dough hook on hand-held or stand mixer on low. Then add in the flour and salt. Add olive oil and keep mixing until the dough comes together into a ball. (Knead by hand if no dough hook is available.)</li>
              <li>Place dough in a large greased bowl. Cover and let rise for one hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
              <li>Divide the dough into 3 pieces. Roll each piece until it is a smooth ball. Roll sides under so that the ball is smooth. Place each ball onto a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and cover. Let rise for 30 minutes.</li>
              <li>Spoon batter evenly into cupcake wells. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
              <li>Preheat the oven to 400F or 200C. Mix together the egg white and water and brush each ball of dough with the egg wash mixture. Bake for about 25 minutes.</li>
              <li>Once cool, use a knife to cut a round piece from the top and remove as much of the filling as desired to create the bread bowl. Fill with soup and enjoy!</li>
